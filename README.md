# Slate Config

This repository is part of the _Slate Framework_. _Slate_ is a responsive, modern web framework written in Sass. It is packed full of features to help you build the most awesome things for the web. This is a copy of the default config variables for reference or use in your own projects if you not using Slate Engine, which has them already set. They are intended to be used with [Slate Core](https://github.com/HashandSalt/slatecore), in your own asset pipeline.

### Quick Start

Download the files and import `_slate-engine.scss` at the top of your sass file to override the default variables. It includes [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), so if you use that already, remove your copy.

### Don't have an asset pipeline?

If you need a way to compile your project, we have that covered too. _Slate Engine_ is a build tool based on Laravel Mix, NPM scripts, and bash. It also has Slate ready wired up, and ready to rock. You can get this [here](https://github.com/HashandSalt/slateengine).
